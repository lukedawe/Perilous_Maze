Pathfinder algorithm pseudocode

while we haven't found the end of the plane
	decide on the shape of the maze piece
	if we aren't going to reach the end of the maze with the new piece
		place the new piece down on the map
		set the current point to add to to the new end of the path
	else
		<< we might need new pieces for these edgecases >>
		try all the other pieces
		then make the end where we currently are
